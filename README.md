# Parking-Garage-Data-List
Program that serves to store information on a made up parking garage but can be changed to serve any service.

I created a program the stores information of vehicles entering a made up parking garage. The data asked by the user is things like plate number, make, model, and other specifics. 
The program can be used as a template to serve any service similar to a parking garage in which data needs to be stored for company functions.
In the future I planned on having it connected to a mySQL to have information stored in a database for better use.

If using this for a template, simply rename the data it is asking the user for.
